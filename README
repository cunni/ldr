Getting started

This code is implemented in MATLAB.  Either open MATLAB in this 
directory, or, once MATLAB is opened, make this directory the current
working directory *and run startup.m*.  There are a number of calls
to util functions and similar that require startup.m to have been run.
====================================================================

====================================================================
Basic Usage Example

The following Matlab code is a simple example of how to run this project

> % first set up parameters
> parms = struct('show_fig',1,'save_fig',0,'randseed',0);
> % now run MAF
> test_maf( 8 , 2 , parms);
> % note that red dimensions are smoother than green (the first two dimensions
of the data) and black (the heuristic solver).

Note that this will run MAF (maximum autocorrelation factors), which 
maximizes the correlation between adjacent points in an effort to 
find dimensions in the data that are most temporally smooth. There is 
also a heuristic version based on old literature that implements an
LDA-like eigenvector solution.  This simply serves as a comparison.
The code will produce a figure with each cardinal dimension of the
data plotted in green, and the ordered MAF dimensions plotted in black
(for the LDA-like method) and red (for the Stiefel method).  Data are 
plotted against the temporal dimension (horizontal dimension). These 
look similar for these simple examples, though the Stiefel method is
numerically superior.  For this result and further explanations, see
the paper (reference below).

Another simple example is;

> test_pca( d , r , parms)

where d and r are the data dimension and the low-dimensional projection
dimension ( r<d ).  

> test_pca( 120 , 4 , parms)

is also perfectly reasonable.  NOTE: these pca examples are entirely 
confirmatory, because we know that standard PCA (with svd) is globally
optimal.  Any departure here from the standard PCA result is numerical
optimization issues.  The error here should be 0 or tiny; if not, increase
the iteration count or decrease the convergence tolerance.

To run several methods and reproduce figure results from the paper, run:

> test_project( 1 , ‘r_sweep’ , 1 , 0); 
> % make sure your editor pastes those quotation marks in a MATLAB acceptable form!
 
Doing so will produce exactly figures 2B, 3B, and 3D from the paper (ref below).
You can then do a ‘d_sweep’, and can then run test_iter, test_lda, and test_convergence to 
reproduce the remaining figures from the paper.  Note that these last three require 
a bit of mucking with the code; see those .m files for details.

Understanding This Code Computationally

Functions like test_* and run_* are simply wrappers to handle various
function calls.  Other than instantiating test data (test_*) and setting
initial points (run_*), these methods hold no intrinsic computation or 
complexity.  All real computation is in:

f_pca
f_maf
minimize_...
project_stiefel

The f_* functions are where the objective and gradient of the optimization
is calculated.  These are typically the vast users of any computational
allocation in this method, because they often operate on the data structures
themselves.    

minimize_stiefel_sd can be seen as a simple steepest descent method (with 
linesearch), with a few Stiefel tweaks.  There is similarly _grassmann_trust
which does a second order trust region optimization over the Grassmann manifold, 
or _grassmann_mosd which does steepest descent using the manopt library (mo).
Any minimize_ routine calls feval multiple times
on f_* to get a current f and gradf (objective and free gradient).  There are also
some alternative inner products (rather than Euclidean inner products)
which add a bit of computation and warrant consideration. This function also
calls project_stiefel, which is a simple svd method that projects any matrix down
to its closest point on the Stiefel manifold, which is to say that calling
project_stiefel( Q ) for any matrix Q gives the closest matrix to Q of the same size 
that has orthonormal columns.  That requires computation also.
